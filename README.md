This repo is from the Udemy course "100 Algorithms Challenge" by Dylan Israel. If you are interested in learning more about the course or going through the challenge yourself, you can find the information here "https://www.udemy.com/100-algorithms-challenge/"

All of the challenges were created by Dylan Israel, all I have done is work out the solutions.
